- id: audit_content_authority
  priority: P2
  status: todo
  description: >
    Add an `audit authority` subcommand to analyze a page for signals
    of trustworthiness and reliability.
  details:
    - Extract author information and publication/last-updated dates.
    - Detect and parse academic-style citations and references.
  impact: Allows an LLM to evaluate the quality and reliability of its sources.

- id: generate_provenance_log
  priority: P2
  status: todo
  description: >
    For each URL processed, generate a deterministic log of the actions
    and decisions made by the tool.
  details:
    - Log cache hits/misses, content type heuristics, and TTL assignments.
    - Include this log in the summary output.
  impact: >
    Makes the tool's operations transparent and auditable, allowing an LLM
    to "show its work" and answer questions about its data gathering process.

- id: cluster_results_by_host
  priority: P2
  status: todo
  description: >
    Add a top-level `clusters` object to the summary output that groups
    results by hostname.
  details:
    - For each host, provide count, average tokens, common path prefixes, etc.
  impact: >
    Gives the LLM an immediate high-level understanding of the source
    material's composition, enabling smarter, cluster-based analysis.

- id: detect_content_changes_and_duplicates
  priority: P2
  status: todo
  description: >
    Implement mechanisms for change detection and content de-duplication.
  details:
    - Use normalized content hashes to detect near-identical content
      across different URLs (e.g., syndicated articles).
  impact: >
    Prevents the LLM from overweighting duplicated content and enables
    foundational temporal reasoning.

- id: detect_boilerplate_fingerprints
  priority: P2
  status: todo
  description: >
    Implement per-domain boilerplate fingerprinting to identify and flag
    repetitive content (headers, footers, nav bars).
  impact: >
    Reduces noise in summaries and allows the LLM to safely ignore
    content that appears on 95% of pages from a domain.

- id: generate_coverage_maps
  priority: P2
  status: todo
  description: >
    Generate explicit "coverage and omission" maps for each page summary.
  details:
    - Report what percentage of page text was included vs. excluded.
    - Note which major block types or sections were dropped.
  impact: >
    Directly reduces hallucinations by making it clear to the LLM what it
    is *not* seeing.
