  # Architecture
  - [x] Concurrent fetch + parse pipeline
  - [x] Deterministic MapReduce corpus aggregation

  # Page-level metadata
  - [x] Extract comprehensive structural metadata
  - [x] Detect content type heuristically
  - [x] Detect language with confidence
  - [x] Estimate reading time and word count
  - [x] Track extraction mode and quality

  # Link analysis
  - [x] Extract internal and external links with anchors

  # Remaining high-value additions (local, deterministic)
  - [ ] Record boilerplate removal signals
      # removed blocks count
      # removal ratio
      # removal source (readability, heuristics)

  - [ ] Add citation anchors to content blocks
      # DOM path
      # byte offset or source range

  - [ ] Generate explicit content quality signals
      # text density
      # link density
      # heading/body ratio
      # average words per block

  - [ ] Add stable content fingerprinting
      # block-level hashes
      # page-level content hash

  - [ ] Enable content change detection across runs
      # hash comparison
      # change classification (minor/major)

notes:
  - TF-IDF and weighting are corpus-level concerns and intentionally deferred
  - All tasks remain deterministic, local, and LLM-free
